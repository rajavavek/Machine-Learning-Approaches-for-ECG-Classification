# Machine-Learning-Approaches-for-ECG-Classification
Heart arrhythmias, characterized by irregular heartbeats, pose serious health risks. Wearable technologies like Apple Watch enable continuous heart activity monitoring, allowing machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal heartbeats and potentially prevent fatalities. This study focuses on classifying individual heartbeats in ECG signals using two approaches: classic machine learning with handcrafted features and deep learning with medical image processing. The LightGBM model, enhanced with handcrafted features and optimized through parameter tuning and SMOTE for data balancing, outperformed other classifiers, achieving precision of 0.94, recall of 0.94, accuracy of 0.99, and F1 score of 0.94. This study highlights the potential of integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques in medical diagnostics, offering a robust approach for accurate heartbeat classification and arrhythmia detection.
